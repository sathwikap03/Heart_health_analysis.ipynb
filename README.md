#  Heart Health Data Analysis

## 📋 Overview
This project analyzes health-related data to explore factors that influence heart disease risk.  
The analysis was performed in **Python using Google Colab**, focusing on **data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis** between health indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and exercise habits.  
The cleaned dataset (cleaned_heart_health_analysis_data.csv) is included in this repository.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File:** heart_health_analysis_ipynb
- **Source:** Heart Disease Dataset (publicly available)
- **Description:**  
  Contains health information such as:
  - Age, gender, chest pain type  
  - Resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels  
  - Fasting blood sugar and resting ECG results  
  - Maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina  
  - ST depression and slope  
  - Target variable indicating heart disease presence (1) or absence (0)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python   
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (optional, for ML or correlations)

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed missing or invalid values  
   - Standardized column names and formats  
   - Converted categorical data into numeric form (if necessary)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of key features (age, cholesterol, heart rate)  
   - Correlation heatmap to identify relationships among health indicators  
   - Visualization of target variable (presence of heart disease)  
   - Comparison of factors affecting heart disease risk

3. **Key Insights**
   - Higher cholesterol and blood pressure levels correlate with heart disease.  
   - Older age groups show a greater risk of heart problems.  
   - Exercise-induced angina and ST depression are strong indicators of heart issues.  
   - Certain chest pain types are more frequently associated with positive diagnoses.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload the dataset health_analysis_data.csv to your Colab session.  
3. Execute all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and graphs.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add logistic regression or random forest models to predict heart disease.  
- Compare results with other heart health datasets.  
- Create an interactive dashboard for medical insights.

## 🧾 Results Summary
This analysis helps identify key medical and lifestyle factors contributing to heart disease.  
It provides a foundation for building predictive models and improving preventive healthcare strategies.
